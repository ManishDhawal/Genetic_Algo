# Genetic_Algo
This project is purely based on C programming for the implementation of Genetic Algorithms.

Genetic Algorithms(GAs) are adaptive heuristic search algorithms that belong to the larger part of evolutionary algorithms. Genetic algorithms are based on the ideas of natural selection and genetics. 

These are intelligent exploitation of random search provided with historical data to direct the search into the region of better performance in solution space. They are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions for optimization problems and search problems.

Now for the project, in general our program is implemented in such a way that it's used to find to find the maximum or minimum value of a given function using the concept of biological chromes and genes.

This program consists of four steps in all:

1. Picking the best chromes.
2. Crossover to generate the child.
3. Mutation with low probability.
4. Loop termination.
